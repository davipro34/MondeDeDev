This ReadMe has been to be updated.

## Back

This project run on Java 21.

It requires a MySQL database (version 8.3.0 is recommended).

## Front

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.6.

Don't forget to install your node_modules before starting (`npm install`).

### Development server
Run `mvn clean install` for back-end installation.
Run `mvn spring-boot:run` for a back-end dev server. It launch back-end on `http://localhost:8080/`.

Run `ng serve` for a front-end dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the front-end of this project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

### Where to start

As you may have seen if you already started the app, a simple home page containing a logo, a title and a button is available. If you take a look at its code (in the `home.component.html`) you will see that an external UI library is already configured in the project.

This library is `@angular/material`, it's one of the most famous in the angular ecosystem. As you can see on their docs (https://material.angular.io/), it contains a lot of highly customizable components that will help you design your interfaces quickly.

Note: I recommend to use material however it's not mandatory, if you prefer you can get ride of it.

Good luck!
